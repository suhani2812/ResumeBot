#ResumeBot
Introduction
Recruitment processes can be overwhelming, especially when faced with a large number of resumes to review. Manual screening is time-consuming and prone to human bias. Our solution aims to automate and streamline this process using NLP.

#Key Objectives
1)Automated Screening: Develop an NLP model to categorize resumes automatically.
2)Objective Evaluation: Ensure fair and consistent evaluation of candidates.
3)Efficiency: Free up recruitersâ€™ time for high-priority tasks.

#Implementation Steps
1)Data Collection:
   Gather labeled resume data (resumes with associated job categories).
2)Data Preprocessing:
   Clean and preprocess resume text.
   Split data into training and testing sets.
3)Feature Extraction:
  Convert resume text into numerical features (e.g., TF-IDF vectors).
4)Machine Learning Models:
  Train classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) on the training data.
  Predict job categories based on resume features.
5)Model Evaluation:
  Assess model performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
6)Deployment:
  Deploy the NLP model as an automated resume screening tool.
